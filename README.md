# Bikesharing
  
## Overview of Project
  
### Purpose
  
I analyzed NYC Citibike public data on ridership in August 2019 to obtain insights into bike usage trends and the types of customer information.
  
## Results
  
See the Tableau Public link for Results on the seven visualizations and descriptions.

## Summary
  
Overall, there are a lot more male riders that utilize the Citibikes in NYC in the summertime, and marketing effort should be heightened accordingly to either entice new gender/identity groups or engage more male riders. Additional visualizations of interest would be figuring out the different starting and stopping points by customer/subscriber and gender. Another potentially interesting analysis would be to examine the geographic locations (starting and stopping points) between weekdays and weekends to see where it might be best to relocate the bikes.
